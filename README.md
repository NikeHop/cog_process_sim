# Bachelor Thesis in Psychology 

One of the grand goals of AI is to create machines that perform human level reasoning. Recent successes in creating intelligent machines are
still far away from human-level capabilities in terms of generalizability and data-efficiency.

One approach to achieving human level reasoning abilities, put forward by [Joshua Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html)
and [Noah Goodman](https://cocolab.stanford.edu/ndg.html) is based on the idea that human structure their knowledge into intuitive theories.
Simply speaking intutive theories are abstract models that humans have about a given domain that contain information
on the entities of the domain, their relation and their interaction. The intutive theory that has been studied the most is intutive physics, it describes how humans explain themselves physical events. 

The thesis looked closer at intuitive psychology, which is a model, humans use to explain other peoples actions. The framework is used to explain the self-serving bias

More explanation on the background can be found in the  thesis.

The framework is not novel and very small. It was mainly set up to experiment with how one could implement abstract intuitive theories that humans use in everyday life to explain a well studied cognitive process.
